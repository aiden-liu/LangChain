      "as a share of revenues doesn’t look markedly different from \n",
      "prior tech investment cycles, and that investors are rewarding \n",
      "only those companies that can tie a dollar of AI spending back \n",

      "assume that generative AI will automate 25% of all work tasks \n",
      "following the technology’s full adoption. \n",
      "Second, Acemoglu’s framework assumes that the primary \n",
